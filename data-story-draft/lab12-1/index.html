            <p class="page__content-blockquote-text">I started my interet when I saw videos of granny Xie in San
              Francisco being attacked then she fought back. As a student who hope to study in New York one day, I
              investigate the reports about Asian American Hate Crime to know what's happening there
            </p>
            <p class="page__content-blockquote-text">What trigers my interets about suspect's race is in one police
              announcement: Watch as @NYPDShea updates the media on new Asian
              hate crime initiatives. I was shocked by one picture that six suspects all belongs to
              the minority group.
            </p>
            <p class="page__content-blockquote-text">Since I already began my research, I recognized some of the six and
              I knew that, some light-skin man also did something bad because the Wordl Journal report thoses
              crimes at the same time. But why are the light-skin missing? If you watch the video, you will see, 8 out
              of 10 belongs to monority. But if you research, there also exist some crimes commited
              by
              light-skin that not accused of hate crime</p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin my research, I choose three influential
                groups who share different readers. Police department offers official and relatively credible
                information about the AAHC cases while the other two media offer different angles and opinions towards
                the same issue. New York Times is one of the most popular main stream newspaper in New York. Thw World
                Journal Newspaper is the largest Chinese language newspaper in the US.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
                get detailed information about Asian American
                Hate crimehappened in New York, I checked multiple sources. For NYPD, I checked their
                offcial website,
                the information they released on Facebook
                Account and
                their twitter account. I watch every post they wrote as well as watching all the video and live
                streaming recording from Jan to March.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For New York Times, I checked their offcial
                website. I filted by date and I read through all the post which may connected with Asian American Hate
                crime. I didn't use the word filter because the word filter may be inaccurate. Also I only record crime
                reported by the New York Times instead of some articles cited by the New York Times. I only record
                artcicles published on the main cite because this show how they write the crime, intsead of how other
                cite write the crime.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the
                World Journal, I checked all the post published on their website because their word filter may also be
                inaccurate.Scrolling and reading all
                the post can be time wasting but I believe that's the best way to avoid missing information.
